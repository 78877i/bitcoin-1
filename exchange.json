It was the first Token in the world to be distributed free of charge to so many people. It was as many as 87 549 users of the Coindeal exchange! 45 000 000 000 Tokens were distributed, which is 90% of all created Tokens. When the market opened for CDL, which took place on November 12, 2019, the value of all Tokens was 1 129 382 USD (382 BTC)! In the beginning, CDL is available together with BTC. The pairs planned for the near future are CDL/EUR and CDL/USDT. Additionally, the exchange offers many benefits from having CDL Tokens on your account.
